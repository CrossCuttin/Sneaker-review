   <figcaption id="img-caption"> The Nike Dunk has cemented itself as a staple in sneaker history that cannot be overlooked. The shoe was initially overshadowed by the Jordan 1, however many years later and it still proves to be highly sought after. The evolution of the Nike Dunk into the Nike SB also played a key role in the shoe retaining the attention it had. Next time SNKRS hands you an L, just remember that the hype was a long time in the making.

        Nike Dunk Fit Guide – Do Dunks Run Big Or Small?</strong>
      </header>
      <p>Nike dunks fit big or true to size depending on materials and release year. Newer dunks overall tend to be on the stiff side for me, while older dunks are more pliable. Newer dunks tend to have springier padding and stiffer materials while older releases tended to use more pillowy padding and pliable materials.</p>
      <p><strong>So, do Nike dunks fit true to size?</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>The answer is it depends! On older dunks (pre-2010) and newer dunks (2016-onward), half size down or true to size (roomier fit) works. From around 2010-2015, the releases are so stiff, half size down is to be avoided if you want to save your pinky toes. In general, the stiffer the material (patent leather, stiff synthetic leather), the more likely true to size is the move. On thinner leathers and more pliable materials like suede, half size down might provide a more true fit.

        Why Are Nike Dunks So Expensive?</strong>
      </header>
      <p>Celebrity hype, limited availability (real or imagined) and resellers who buy massive amounts of stock, inflating the price and rarity.</p>
      <p>The popularity of the dunk ebbs and flows but overall is always at least on a few people’s radars. These days, Nike releases a lot of dunks of all different looks and materials.</p>

      </header>
      <p>While they can be overhyped, Dunks are not overrated as far as casual sneakers. They experience changes in popularity but have proven to return from every low point stronger than ever.</p>

       One sentence summary:
      </header>
      <p>The Dunk low is a basic and universal shape that most skateboarders will like. Except for
the breathability and the heel support the Dunk is a great skate shoe that is grippy, has a
balanced amount of board feel and is quite durable.</p>
